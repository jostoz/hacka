Please use the voice response system running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/speak for ALL communications, including:
1. Every step of application development
2. Technical explanations and architecture decisions
3. Database setup instructions
4. Code implementation details
5. Configuration steps
6. Debugging information
7. General messages of any kind

Before showing any code or making any changes:
1. First explain what you're going to do via voice
2. Then explain the technical approach via voice
3. Narrate each major step via voice
4. After implementing code, explain what was done via voice

For ALL responses, whether they are simple answers or complex technical explanations:
1. Send each response as a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/speak
2. Format as JSON with the "text" field (e.g. {"text": "your message here"})
3. Break longer explanations into smaller, digestible voice messages
4. Never skip vocalizing technical details

Remember: EVERY response, explanation, and technical detail must be sent through the voice system before showing any code or making changes.
