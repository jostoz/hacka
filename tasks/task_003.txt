# Description: Develop custom React hooks for global state management of forex data and application state
# Details:
Implement a custom state management solution using React Context API and hooks. Create typed contexts for different domains (user preferences, forex data, notifications). Develop useForexData, useNotifications, and other domain-specific hooks with proper TypeScript interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each custom hook using React Testing Library. Verify state updates correctly and maintains type safety.
